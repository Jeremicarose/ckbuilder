# Builder Track Weekly Report — Week 16

**Name:** Jeremic  
**Week Ending:** 21 - 28 June

---

## Overview

This week focused on live-ingest readiness. Work centered on replacing simulation-first assumptions with real bridge paths, building Beast-based ingestion adapters, and identifying the real remaining blocker: absence of actual receiver hardware or remote Beast sources.

---

## Key Accomplishments

### Command-JSONL Live Path

* Promoted `command-jsonl` to the most practical first non-simulation ingest mode.
* Added:

  * generic bridge adapter
  * sample live bridge helper
  * command-jsonl guidance in docs and config

### Beast Ingest Adapters

* Built a Beast TCP adapter skeleton for:

  * `readsb`
  * `dump1090-fa`

This adapter can read Beast-format frames and emit normalized JSONL suitable for the MLAT runtime.

### Multi-Receiver Bridge

* Added a multi-receiver Beast bridge launcher.
* Added a receiver config format for multiple Beast endpoints.
* Wrote a runtime guide showing how to run `mlat-processor` against multiple real Beast receivers once endpoints are available.

### Live-Ingest Readiness Checks

* Added a machine-readiness diagnostic to check whether the host is actually capable of real live ingest.
* This check now surfaces blockers such as:

  * missing SDR hardware
  * missing Beast endpoints
  * simulation/live transport mismatch

### Environment Shift

* Moved local/default guidance away from simulation and toward real bridge-based ingestion paths.

## Key Learnings

### The Main Blocker Is No Longer Code

By the end of this week, the project had the necessary scaffolding for:

* Beast input
* bridge normalization
* multi-receiver ingest

The real blocker is now:

> no actual live observation source is currently available

### Hardware / Endpoint Reality Check

Confirmed that:

* `readsb` can be installed
* the bridge tooling works
* but without:

  * local SDR hardware
  * or remote Beast endpoints

the system still cannot produce real live aircraft MLAT output

### Live Benchmarking Depends on Real Inputs

All benchmark tooling is now ready, but it remains dependent on real observations rather than replay traffic.

---

## Current Project Status

The project now includes:

* generic bridge adapter
* sample live bridge helper
* Beast TCP adapter
* multi-receiver Beast bridge
* local live-ingest readiness check
* runtime documentation for multi-receiver Beast setups

This means the project is:

* benchmark-ready in tooling
* ingest-ready in architecture
* still blocked by lack of actual live source input

---

## Next Steps

* connect a real receiver source
* or obtain remote Beast endpoints
* feed real aircraft observations into the runtime
* verify:

  * `synthetic_feed_mode = false`
  * `benchmarkable_output = true`
* run the first meaningful external benchmark
