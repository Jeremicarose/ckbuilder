# Builder Track Weekly Report — Week 15

**Name:** Jeremic  
**Week Ending:** 15 - 20 June

---

## Overview

This week focused on making the project benchmark-ready. The main progress was building the tooling to export MLAT output, fetch OpenSky reference data, compare the two, and formalize project readiness around benchmarkable output versus simulated output.

---

## Key Accomplishments

### Benchmark Tooling

* Added MLAT export tooling for benchmark comparison.
* Added OpenSky reference fetch tooling.
* Added benchmark comparison tooling to calculate:

  * matched records
  * coverage ratio
  * horizontal error
  * altitude error

### Benchmark Documentation

* Added benchmark data format documentation.
* Added a benchmark report template.
* Added a first benchmark plan using the Northeast corridor as the initial comparison region.

### Readiness Surface

* Added a dedicated readiness endpoint to summarize the platform’s state across:

  * quality
  * freshness
  * reliability
  * packaging

### Benchmarkability Distinction

* Added explicit logic to distinguish:

  * internally measurable output
  * truly benchmarkable live output

This prevents replay/synthetic output from being mistaken for real benchmark evidence.

### OpenSky Comparison Path

* Chose OpenSky as the best first real reference source because it provides:

  * official, documented API access
  * structured flight state data
  * a practical first external benchmark target

---

## Key Learnings

### Instrumentation Is Not the Same as External Proof

The system can now measure many internal properties, but that still does not prove:

* better accuracy
* better completeness
* lower latency than incumbents

until external comparison data is actually run.

### Benchmarkability Must Be Honest

A major lesson this week was that replay/simulation output is useful for:

* UI testing
* API validation
* workflow validation

but not for making real external quality claims.

### OpenSky Is a Good First Comparator

It may not be the final market comparator, but it is the most practical first external reference for starting benchmark work.

---

## Current Project Status

The project now includes:

* benchmark exporter
* OpenSky fetcher
* benchmark comparator
* benchmark plan and templates
* readiness endpoint
* clearer distinction between internal readiness and external proof

---

## Next Steps

* connect a real observation source so benchmarks are meaningful
* move away from replay-only/simulation-only output
* generate the first valid external benchmark against trusted reference data
* continue preparing the system for real live ingestion
